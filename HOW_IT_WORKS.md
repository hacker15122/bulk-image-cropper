# 🔍 How Your Web App Works - Complete Guide

## 📱 **User Experience Flow**

### **1. User Visits Your Website**
- User opens your website URL (e.g., `https://your-app.onrender.com`)
- Each user gets a **unique session ID** automatically
- User sees a beautiful, modern interface

### **2. Image Upload Process**
```
User selects images → Files uploaded to server → Stored temporarily → Ready for processing
```

**What happens:**
- User clicks "Choose Files" button
- Selects multiple images (JPG, PNG, etc.)
- Images are uploaded to your server
- Each user's files are **separated and secure**
- Files get unique names to prevent conflicts

### **3. AI Processing**
```
Uploaded images → AI face detection → Smart cropping → ID card style output
```

**AI Technology used:**
- **MediaPipe** - Google's AI for face detection
- **OpenCV** - Image processing and cropping
- **Smart cropping** - Automatically finds face + tie area
- **Aspect ratio** - Maintains perfect ID card dimensions (1:1.285)

### **4. Download Process**
```
Processed images → User downloads → Files saved to their computer
```

**How downloads work:**
- User sees "Download" button for each processed image
- Clicking downloads the cropped image directly
- Files are saved to user's Downloads folder
- **Each user can only download their own images**

## 🏗️ **Technical Architecture**

### **File Storage System**
```
User Session 1: [upload1.jpg, upload2.jpg] → [cropped1.jpg, cropped2.jpg]
User Session 2: [upload3.jpg, upload4.jpg] → [cropped3.jpg, cropped4.jpg]
```

**Key Features:**
- ✅ **User isolation** - Each user sees only their files
- ✅ **Session management** - Files linked to user's browser session
- ✅ **Automatic cleanup** - Old files deleted after 1 hour
- ✅ **Security** - Users can't access each other's files

### **Server Processing**
```
Web Request → Flask App → AI Processing → File Storage → Download Response
```

**What happens on server:**
1. **Receive upload** - Save file with unique name
2. **AI processing** - Detect face, calculate crop area
3. **Image cropping** - Apply AI results + maintain aspect ratio
4. **File storage** - Save processed image
5. **Download ready** - User can download anytime
